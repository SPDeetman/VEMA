Vehicle Material Model

This model uses data from the IMAGE model data on transport demand for freight and passenger transport (in ton-km & person-km) to derive the number of vehicles (stock/fleet) required to fulfill this demand on an annual basis, and the material use related to those vehicles (both in terms of total stock and annual production).

The original transport model was described by Bastien Girod: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301421512001127?via%3Dihub
With recent data and updates from Oreane Edelenbosch. The model was developed by Sebastiaan Deetman (deetman@cml.leidenuniv.nl) with lots of data input from Rombout Huisman.

This model uses the python Dynamic Stock module as developed by Stefan Pauliuk, Uni Freiburg, Germany. For the original code & latest updates of that module, please see: https://github.com/IndEcol/ODYM

Please do not use any parts of the model or its results without consent of the author (deetman@cml.leidenuniv.nl)
